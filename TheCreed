# The Creed

I believe in One God, Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth and of all things visible and invisible;
And in One Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only Begotten, begotten of the Father before all ages.
Light of Light, True God of True God.
Begotten, not made, of One Essence with the Father, by whom all things were made;
Who for us men and for our Salvation came down from Heaven.
He was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man.
He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried;
On the Third Day He rose again according to the Scriptures;
He ascended into Heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father;
He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, whose Kingdom shall have no end.
And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life who proceeds from the Father,
Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, Who spoke by the prophets.
In One Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, I acknowledge One Baptism for the remission of sins.
I look for the Resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.
Amen.
